# DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

A portfolio website template show off some of the the projects I have worked on. Some of them are projects I did at Bucknell, some of them just passion projects I thought would be fun to work on. 

It is also my playground to mess around with web design and coding, so some stuff might do wierd stuff.
